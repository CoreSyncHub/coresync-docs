# Overview

NGX Query is a data-fetching library for Angular applications, inspired by TanStack Query. It provides a minimal and flexible API for managing server state, caching, and synchronizing data with your UI.

## Key Features

NGX Query offers several powerful features to enhance your data management:

- **Native Angular Integration**: Built specifically for Angular, it's observable-based and leverages Angular's dependency injection system and SSR friendly.
- **Fluent API**: Define queries and mutations with a builder pattern for clear and declarative usage.
- **Caching & Invalidation**: Automatic caching with configurable stale times, garbage collection, and fine-grained invalidation.
- **Reactive by Design**: Results are streams (`Observable`) that integrate seamlessly with Angular templates and RxJS operators.
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instantly reflect UI changes while mutations are in-flight, with rollback on failure.
- **Error & Retry Strategies**: Built-in retry policies and error handling out of the box.
- **Focus & Reconnect Awareness**: Automatic refetching when the app window regains focus or reconnects to the network.
- **SSR & TransferState Support**: Compatible with Angular Universal for fast server-side rendering and hydration.
- **Signal Interop**: Simple utilities to bridge Observables with Angularâ€™s Signals for zoneless rendering.

## When to Use

Use **NGX Query** if your application needs:

- Reliable synchronization of server state with UI.
- Data deduplication and caching across components.
- Configurable refetching strategies (interval, focus, reconnect).
- Declarative queries and mutations with strong typing.
- A professional-grade alternative to ad-hoc `HttpClient` calls.

## Comparison with TanStack Query

NGX Query is inspired by **TanStack Query**, but designed for Angular:

- **Observables-first** instead of Promises for native Angular integration.
- **Dependency Injection** instead of React/Vanilla context providers.
- **Fluent Builder API** to define queries/mutations in a clear and composable way.
- **SSR & TransferState** integration out of the box for Angular Universal.
- No external runtime dependencies beyond Angular and RxJS.
